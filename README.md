# E-verify-companies
In this project, we will use a public dataset to get a systematic understanding about companies enrolled in the E-verify program. 

The data is downloaded from the following website. 

https://www.e-verify.gov/about-e-verify/e-verify-data/how-to-find-participating-employers

The file "employer-export.csv" contains the relevant information. Our data analyses are explained in the jupyter notebook "E-verify companies". 

I am thankful to Minh Nguyen for clarifications about this dataset.
